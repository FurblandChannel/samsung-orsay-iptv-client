# BE FOREWARNED:
This is VERY EARLY ON in development. Do not expect this to work on a real device. The parser script is fully functional, but that's about it. The HTML file is just a test for basic functionality at this point. If you for some reason want to run this, it should be fairly easy to figure out (albeit you will need to change some URLs around in the HTML). Oh yeah, and also I just have it running on some test JSON currently. There's a thing you can uncomment if you want it to fetch the actual JSON.
